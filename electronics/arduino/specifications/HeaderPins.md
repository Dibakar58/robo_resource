# Digital Pins

<p1> The two digital pin headers are along the top. These are the Digital Inputs or Outputs that you'll be using to control a relay, 
    blink an LED, switches or connect to more complex components. They use 5V for HIGH signals, and 0V for LOW signals. </p1>
<p1> Starting from the right... </p1>
* <p1> The two pins labelled 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) are the two Serial pins that are used to send data to and from the Arduino to the USB-Serial translator chip. 
       <b1> Don't connect anything to Digital 0 or 1 unless you are super sure because it will affect Arduino's ability to communicate!</b> </p1>
