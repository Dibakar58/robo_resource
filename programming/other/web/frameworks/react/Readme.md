# React
 
ReactJS is a javascript _library_ used to build user interfaces. It was developed and released by facebook in 2013 and now has a big community of developers using and maintaining ReactJS

> Contrary to popular beliefs React is *not a framework* but is rather a Javascrcipt library. 

React helps break down your website into reusable _components_ that are written in a special markup language called *JSX* (_Javascript XML_). This allows us to write _HTML-like_ code inside javscript.

> *JSX* and *components* are the two main features of React that make it easy to devevlop complex web applications very quickly.
